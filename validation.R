lm.fit <- lm(mpg~horsepower, data = Auto, subset = train)
# Now we use predict() function to estimate the response for all 392 observations,
# and we use the mean() function to calculate the MSE of the 196 observations in the
# validation set. Note that the -train selects only the observations that are not in,
# the training set.

mean((mpg-predict(lm.fit,Auto))[-train]^2)
# Therefore, the estimated test MSE for the linear regression fit is 26.14
